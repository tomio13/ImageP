    """ Apply the structure tensor method on an image.
        This method uses local differentials to detect edges and corners.
        Possible output are the amplitude of edges, the angle derived,
        and an 'R' parameter calculated as:
        R = J11*J22-J12*J12 - 0.05*ampl**2

        Parameters:
        img:        image (2D)
        keys:       what to return? 'a' amplitude, 't' theta, angle in radians
                    'd' angle in degrees, 'r' R parameter
                    'e' egienvalues (e1, e2), 'c' for coherence

        threshold:  used to define index from the amplitude image (amp > th*amp.max())
        radius:     for the Gaussian, window is 2r+1
        width:      standard deviation of the Gaussian; increasing will give
                    larger smoothing in the image

        SmoothFactor:   increase width with this factor for the smoothing
                        operation (first calculate the derivatives, then
                        average them with a Gaussian kernel. This defines
                        the sigma for the smoothing kernel)
        H           Harris parameter for R = det(A) - H Tr^2(A),
                    where 'A" is the smoothed matrix.

        a dict with the various output images generated according to key
